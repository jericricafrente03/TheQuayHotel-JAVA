Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

The moon is staring from the sky
Oh we are right under starin' eye to eye

Why don't you hold me tight
And stay here for the night
Oh, I don't want you to go
I will keep you warm
Wrap you in my arms
And never let you go

Until the morning
After tonight
Until the morning
After tonight

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Oh put your face against my chest
When you touch me it takes my breath away

Why don't you hold me tight
And stay here for the night
Oh, I don't want you to go
I will keep you warm
Wrap you in my arms
And never let you go

Until the morning
After tonight
Until the morning
After tonight

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Why don't you hold me tight
And stay here for the night
I don't want you to go
I will keep you warm
Wrap you in my arms
And never let you go

Until the morning
After tonight
Until the morning
After tonight

Until the morning
After tonight
Until the morning
After tonight (hold me tight)

Until the morning
After tonight
Until the morning
After tonight
